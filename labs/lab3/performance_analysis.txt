The computation time for each Thread increases because the private variable "threadNum" 
is passed to the doComputation(), which increase the time spend computing the value.
This leads to a load imbalance where the program must wait for the longest thread to
finish before moving continuing. Therefore, Thread 4 becomes a dependency that limits
performance.
